It is member of the Haemodoraceae family. It is commonly known as the tall, yellow, or evergreen, kangaroo paw. The specific epithet, flavidus, refers to the yellow flowers of this plant.A member of the genus Anigozanthos (kangaroo- and cats-paws) that has an evergreen clump of strap-like leaves, up to 1 metre long and 0.2 m wide, growing from an underground rhizome around 0.5 m in diameter. The rhizome allows the species to regenerate after drought or fire. Each plant may  produce over 350 flowers, on up to 10 long stems, these appear during the summer of the region. Pollen is distributed by birds as they plunge into the flowers to reach the nectaries. Flowers are frequently yellow and green, but may present in shades of red, pink, orange, or brown. It is found along roadsides, along creeks, and in forests and swamps, and other unshaded winterwet habitat.The species occurs in a range from Two Peoples Bay in the southeast, throughout the Warren and southern Jarrah Forest, to Waroona on the Swan Coastal Plain. It was previously endemic to the region, but is now naturalised in New South Wales. This kangaroo paw is now widely cultivated in the Eastern states of Australia and the United States of America.\\\\r\\\\nAnigozanthos flavidus hybridises with other members of the genus, and is used in the development of cultivars. It is a hardy plant, tolerant of a wide range of soil types and condition, that may live for around 30 years in a garden. It is propagated from seed or sections of the rhizome.The first description of the species was by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1807. This was published in Redout\\u00e9's Les Liliacees with an illustration by that artist.\\\\nEvergreen Kangaroo Paw\\\\n2\\\\n[\\\\\\\"Assorted Black Cream Red Yellow\\\\\\\"]\\\\nTender\\\\nFast\\\\nTRUE\\\\nFull Sun to Part Shade\\\\nwAW2S+/3d/avGDOZ7/tW9A==\\\\ntext/csv\\\\n.csv\\\\nnew_2.csv\\\\nhttps://stradegio2aistorage.blob.core.windows.net/plant-data-3/new_2.csv\\\\n[\\\\\\\"western Australia\\\\\\\"]\\\\n1-5m\\\\n2\\\\nSouth west corner of Western Australia\\\\nSmall\\\\nSmall\\\\nAnnual/Perennial\\\\nAnnual/Perennial\\\\n0.2\\\\nAnigozanthos flavidus\\\\nMedium\\\", \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"title\\\": null, \\\"filepath\\\": null, \\\"url\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"chunking\\\": \\\"orignal document size=642.

Widely distributed, it is found as an understorey plant in open dry forest or heathland from Victoria to northern Queensland, generally on sandstone though sometimes also clay soils. It generally grows as a small shrub to 2 metres (7 ft) in height, though can be a straggly tree to 6 metres (20 ft). It has long narrow leaves with inflorescences which can vary considerably in coloration; while the spikes are gold or less commonly yellowish, the emergent styles may be a wide range of colours \\u2013 from black, purple, red, orange or yellow.\\\\r\\\\nBanksia spinulosa was named by James Edward Smith in England in 1793, after being collected by John White, most likely in 1792. He gave it the common name prickly-leaved banksia, though this has fallen out of use. With four currently recognised varieties, the species has had a complicated taxonomic history, with two varieties initially described as separate species in the early 19th century. A fourth, from the New England region, has only recently been described. However, there has been disagreement whether one, var. cunninghamii, is distinct enough to once again have specific status. The pre-eminent authority on Banksia, Alex George, concedes there is still more work to be done on the Banksia spinulosa complex.\\\\r\\\\nThe hairpin banksia is pollinated by and provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. Its floral display and fine foliage have made it a popular garden plant with many horticultural selections available. With the recent trend towards smaller gardens, compact dwarf forms of Banksia spinulosa have become popular; the first available, Banksia 'Birthday Candles', has achieved a great deal of commercial success and wide recognition, and has been followed by several others.\\\\nGolden Candlesticks\\\\n283\\\\n[\\\\\\\"Golden Orange\\\\\\\"]\\\\nHardy\\\\nMedium\\\\nTRUE\\\\nFull Sun to Part Shade\\\\nwAW2S+/3d/avGDOZ7/tW9A==\\\\ntext/csv\\\\n.csv\\\\nnew_2.csv\\\\nhttps://stradegio2aistorage.blob.core.windows.net/plant-data-3/new_2.csv\\\\n[\\\\\\\"New South Wales\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\" Queensland\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\" Victoria\\\\\\\"]\\\\n1-5m\\\\n2\\\\nEastern Australia\\\\nSmall\\\\nSmall\\\\nShrub\\\\nShrub\\\\n2\\\\nBanksia spinulosa\\\\nWind/Salt tolerant\\\", \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"title\\\": null, \\\"filepath\\\": null, \\\"url\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"chunking\\\": \\\"orignal document size=634.

Found from Bundaberg south to Sydney on the Australian east coast, it is encountered as a shrub or a tree to 8 m (26 ft) in coastal heath on deep sandy soil, known as Wallum. It has wrinkled orange bark and shiny green serrated leaves, with green-yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, appearing in autumn. The flower spikes turn grey as they age and large grey follicles appear. Banksia aemula resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfires.\\\\r\\\\nFirst described by the botanist Robert Brown in the early 19th century, it derives its specific name \\\\\\\"similar\\\\\\\" from its resemblance to the closely related Banksia serrata. No varieties are recognised. It was known for many years in New South Wales as Banksia serratifolia, contrasting with the use of B. aemula elsewhere. However, the former name, originally coined by Richard Anthony Salisbury, proved invalid, and Banksia aemula has been universally adopted as the correct scientific name since 1981. A wide array of mammals, birds, and invertebrates visit the inflorescences and are instrumental in pollination; honeyeaters are particularly prominent visitors. Grown as a garden plant, it is less commonly seen in horticulture than its close relative B. serrata.\\\\nBanyalla\\\\n2\\\\n[\\\\\\\"Yellow\\\\\\\"]\\\\nHardy\\\\nMedium\\\\nTRUE\\\\nFull Sun\\\\nwAW2S+/3d/avGDOZ7/tW9A==\\\\ntext/csv\\\\n.csv\\\\nnew_2.csv\\\\nhttps://stradegio2aistorage.blob.core.windows.net/plant-data-3/new_2.csv\\\\n[\\\\\\\"New South Wales\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\" Queensland\\\\\\\"]\\\\n>5m\\\\n6\\\\nEast Coast Australia\\\\nLarge\\\\nLarge\\\\nShrub\\\\nShrub\\\\n3\\\\nBanksia aemula\\\\nWind/Salt tolerant\\\", \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"title\\\": null, \\\"filepath\\\": null, \\\"url\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"chunking\\\": \\\"orignal document size=495.

In spring to early summer it produces mass displays of attractive star-shaped flowers usually borne in short panicles with each flower up to 70 mm diameter and possessing four narrow white or cream tepals. Fertile male and female reproductive structures occur in flowers of separate plants (dioecy) making this species an obligate outcrosser with pollen movement among plants most likely facilitated by insects. Each seed head (or infructescence) on female plants consists of multiple achenes (an aeterio) with each seed bearing a plumose awn 2\\u20134.5 cm long promoting dispersal by wind.\\\\r\\\\nThe mature leaves are most commonly ternate with leaflets up to 80 mm long and petioles that are able to twine around objects to provide climbing support. Juvenile leaves are simple, usually purplish-tinged with whitish streaks along the main veins.Several varieties have been previously described but are now not formally recognised. These included:\\\\r\\\\nvar. blanda -  with small flowers and twice-divided leaflets which is found from Victoria to Tasmania\\\\r\\\\nvar. dennisae - with red filaments in the flowers and found in eastern Victoria\\\\r\\\\nvar. longiseta - with yellowish hairy flowers found in QueenslandCytological analysis has shown C. aristata to be diploid with a somatic chromosome number of 2n=16.

It also has a kind of fruit that looks like a little urn.\\n\\n### Requirements: \\nThe Red-flowering Gum loves lots of sunlight and grows fast. It's also tough enough to handle windy places and salty air.\\n\\n### Care: \\nIt's a tree that's easy to take care of once it's planted in a sunny spot. It can grow to be more than 5 meters tall, so make sure it has enough room to grow up!\\n\\n### Fun Facts: \\nEven though it's called a gum tree, it doesn't have the kind of gum you chew! It's also really popular for planting in gardens because it looks so beautiful when it flowers[doc1].\\n\\n^^^\",\n",

Found from Bundaberg south to Sydney on the Australian east coast, it is encountered as a shrub or a tree to 8 m (26 ft) in coastal heath on deep sandy soil, known as Wallum. It has wrinkled orange bark and shiny green serrated leaves, with green-yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, appearing in autumn. The flower spikes turn grey as they age and large grey follicles appear. Banksia aemula resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfires.\\\\r\\\\nFirst described by the botanist Robert Brown in the early 19th century, it derives its specific name \\\\\\\"similar\\\\\\\" from its resemblance to the closely related Banksia serrata. No varieties are recognised. It was known for many years in New South Wales as Banksia serratifolia, contrasting with the use of B. aemula elsewhere. However, the former name, originally coined by Richard Anthony Salisbury, proved invalid, and Banksia aemula has been universally adopted as the correct scientific name since 1981. A wide array of mammals, birds, and invertebrates visit the inflorescences and are instrumental in pollination; honeyeaters are particularly prominent visitors. Grown as a garden plant, it is less commonly seen in horticulture than its close relative B. serrata.\\\\nBanyalla\\\\n2\\\\n[\\\\\\\"Yellow\\\\\\\"]\\\\nHardy\\\\nMedium\\\\nTRUE\\\\nFull Sun\\\\nwAW2S+/3d/avGDOZ7/tW9A==\\\\ntext/csv\\\\n.csv\\\\nnew_2.csv\\\\nhttps://stradegio2aistorage.blob.core.windows.net/plant-data-3/new_2.csv\\\\n[\\\\\\\"New South Wales\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\" Queensland\\\\\\\"]\\\\n>5m\\\\n6\\\\nEast Coast Australia\\\\nLarge\\\\nLarge\\\\nShrub\\\\nShrub\\\\n3\\\\nBanksia aemula\\\\nWind/Salt tolerant\\\", \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"title\\\": null, \\\"filepath\\\": null, \\\"url\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"chunking\\\": \\\"orignal document size=495.

The plant's leaves are sessile (stalk-less) and hug the stem with heart-shaped bases. Its previous name \\u2013 A. cordifolia \\u2013 referred to these cordate leaves. Another distinctive feature are the red bristly hairs that cover the branchlets, flower bases and new growth. This leads to the specific epithet hispida (meaning 'bristly').\\\\nDwarf Apple\\\\n370\\\\n[\\\\\\\"Cream White\\\\\\\"]\\\\nHardy\\\\nMedium\\\\nTRUE\\\\nFull Sun\\\\nwAW2S+/3d/avGDOZ7/tW9A==\\\\ntext/csv\\\\n.csv\\\\nnew_2.csv\\\\nhttps://stradegio2aistorage.blob.core.windows.net/plant-data-3/new_2.csv\\\\n[\\\\\\\"New South Wales\\\\\\\"]\\\\n>5m\\\\n6\\\\nNew South Wales\\\\nOthers\\\\nTree\\\\nTree\\\\nTree\\\\n4\\\\nAngophora hispida\\\\nWind/Salt tolerant\\\", \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"title\\\": null, \\\"filepath\\\": null, \\\"url\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"chunking\\\": \\\"orignal document size=352.
