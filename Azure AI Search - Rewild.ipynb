In spring to early summer it produces mass displays of attractive star-shaped flowers usually borne in short panicles with each flower up to 70 mm diameter and possessing four narrow white or cream tepals. Fertile male and female reproductive structures occur in flowers of separate plants (dioecy) making this species an obligate outcrosser with pollen movement among plants most likely facilitated by insects. Each seed head (or infructescence) on female plants consists of multiple achenes (an aeterio) with each seed bearing a plumose awn 2\\u20134.5 cm long promoting dispersal by wind.\\\\r\\\\nThe mature leaves are most commonly ternate with leaflets up to 80 mm long and petioles that are able to twine around objects to provide climbing support. Juvenile leaves are simple, usually purplish-tinged with whitish streaks along the main veins.Several varieties have been previously described but are now not formally recognised. These included:\\\\r\\\\nvar. blanda -  with small flowers and twice-divided leaflets which is found from Victoria to Tasmania\\\\r\\\\nvar. dennisae - with red filaments in the flowers and found in eastern Victoria\\\\r\\\\nvar. longiseta - with yellowish hairy flowers found in QueenslandCytological analysis has shown C. aristata to be diploid with a somatic chromosome number of 2n=16.

It has wrinkled orange bark and shiny green serrated leaves, with green-yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, appearing in autumn. The flower spikes turn grey as they age and large grey follicles appear. Banksia aemula resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfires.\\\\r\\\\nFirst described by the botanist Robert Brown in the early 19th century, it derives its specific name \\\\\\\"similar\\\\\\\" from its resemblance to the closely related Banksia serrata. No varieties are recognised. It was known for many years in New South Wales as Banksia serratifolia, contrasting with the use of B. aemula elsewhere. However, the former name, originally coined by Richard Anthony Salisbury, proved invalid, and Banksia aemula has been universally adopted as the correct scientific name since 1981. A wide array of mammals, birds, and invertebrates visit the inflorescences and are instrumental in pollination; honeyeaters are particularly prominent visitors.

Several species of honeyeaters visit the flower spikes, as do ants and the European honey bee. The response to bushfire depends on the subspecies; subspecies paludosa regenerates from underground lignotubers, while plants of subspecies astrolux are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy.

First described in 1798 by English botanist James Edward Smith, it is the type species of the small genus Lambertia. It is generally found in heathland or open forest, growing in sandstone-based soils. It grows as a multistemmed shrub to around 2 m (7 ft) with a woody base known as a lignotuber, from which it regrows after bushfire. It has stiff narrow leaves, and the pink to red flowerheads, made up of seven individual tubular flowers, generally appear in spring and summer. It gains its common name from the horned woody follicles, which were used to make small devil-figures.\\\\r\\\\nThe flowers hold profuse amounts of nectar and are pollinated by honeyeaters. Although L. formosa is uncommon in cultivation, it is straightforward to grow in soils with good drainage and a partly shaded to sunny aspect. It is readily propagated by seed.

Native to the east coast of Australia, it is found from Queensland to Victoria with outlying populations on Tasmania and Flinders Island. Commonly growing as a gnarled tree up to 16 m (50 ft) in height, it can be much smaller in more exposed areas. This Banksia species has wrinkled grey bark, shiny dark green serrated leaves and large yellow or greyish-yellow flower spikes appearing over summer.

There are no recognised varieties, although it is closely related to Banksia aemula.  Throughout its range, it grows exclusively in sandy soil, and is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. B. serrata is pollinated by and provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months, and is an important source of food for honeyeaters.

It is a shrub with grey-green, pine-like foliage covered with soft hairs and red, four-part flowers in spring. Widely cultivated because of its attractive foliage, colourful, unusual and prolific flowers, it grows in a variety of habitats and soils. In 2010, Alex George published a review of the species based on recent research and described a number of new subspecies.

It is native to a relatively small patch of central New South Wales \\u2013 from just south of Sydney up to the Gosford area. The plant's leaves are sessile (stalk-less) and hug the stem with heart-shaped bases. Its previous name \\u2013 A. cordifolia \\u2013 referred to these cordate leaves. Another distinctive feature are the red bristly hairs that cover the branchlets, flower bases and new growth. This leads to the specific epithet hispida (meaning 'bristly').\\\\nDwarf Apple\\\\n370\\\\n[\\\\\\\"Cream White\\\\\\\"]\\\\nHardy\\\\nMedium\\\\nTRUE\\\\nFull Sun\\\\nwAW2S+/3d/avGDOZ7/tW9A==\\\\ntext/csv\\\\n.csv\\\\nnew_2.csv\\\\nhttps://stradegio2aistorage.blob.core.windows.net/plant-data-3/new_2.csv\\\\n[\\\\\\\"New South Wales\\\\\\\"]\\\\n>5m\\\\n6\\\\nNew South Wales\\\\nOthers\\\\nTree\\\\nTree\\\\nTree\\\\n4\\\\nAngophora hispida\\\\nWind/Salt tolerant\\\", \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"title\\\": null, \\\"filepath\\\": null, \\\"url\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"chunking\\\": \\\"orignal document size=352.

Native to the east coast of Australia, it is found from Queensland to Victoria with outlying populations on Tasmania and Flinders Island. Commonly growing as a gnarled tree up to 16 m (50 ft) in height, it can be much smaller in more exposed areas. This Banksia species has wrinkled grey bark, shiny dark green serrated leaves and large yellow or greyish-yellow flower spikes appearing over summer. The flower spikes, or inflorescences, turn grey as they age and pollinated flowers develop into large, grey, woody seed pods called follicles.\\\\r\\\\nB. serrata is one of the four original Banksia species collected by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770, and one of four species published in 1782 as part of Carolus Linnaeus the Younger's original description of the genus. There are no recognised varieties, although it is closely related to Banksia aemula.  Throughout its range, it grows exclusively in sandy soil, and is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. B. serrata is pollinated by and provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months, and is an important source of food for honeyeaters. It is a common plant of parks and gardens.\\\\nSaw Banksia\\\\n694\\\\n[\\\\\\\"Yellow\\\\\\\"]\\\\nMarginal\\\\nMedium\\\\nTRUE\\\\nFull Sun\\\\nwAW2S+/3d/avGDOZ7/tW9A==\\\\ntext/csv\\\\n.csv\\\\nnew_2.csv\\\\nhttps://stradegio2aistorage.blob.core.windows.net/plant-data-3/new_2.csv\\\\n[\\\\\\\"New South Wales\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\" Queensland\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\" Tasmania\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\" Victoria\\\\\\\"]\\\\n>5m\\\\n10\\\\nEastern Australia\\\\nOthers\\\\nTree\\\\nShrub\\\\nShrub\\\\n3\\\\nBanksia serrata\\\\nWind/Salt tolerant\\\", \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"title\\\": null, \\\"filepath\\\": null, \\\"url\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"chunking\\\": \\\"orignal document size=526.

Found from Bundaberg south to Sydney on the Australian east coast, it is encountered as a shrub or a tree to 8 m (26 ft) in coastal heath on deep sandy soil, known as Wallum. It has wrinkled orange bark and shiny green serrated leaves, with green-yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, appearing in autumn. The flower spikes turn grey as they age and large grey follicles appear. Banksia aemula resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfires.\\\\r\\\\nFirst described by the botanist Robert Brown in the early 19th century, it derives its specific name \\\\\\\"similar\\\\\\\" from its resemblance to the closely related Banksia serrata. No varieties are recognised. It was known for many years in New South Wales as Banksia serratifolia, contrasting with the use of B. aemula elsewhere. However, the former name, originally coined by Richard Anthony Salisbury, proved invalid, and Banksia aemula has been universally adopted as the correct scientific name since 1981. A wide array of mammals, birds, and invertebrates visit the inflorescences and are instrumental in pollination; honeyeaters are particularly prominent visitors. Grown as a garden plant, it is less commonly seen in horticulture than its close relative B. serrata.\\\\nBanyalla\\\\n2\\\\n[\\\\\\\"Yellow\\\\\\\"]\\\\nHardy\\\\nMedium\\\\nTRUE\\\\nFull Sun\\\\nwAW2S+/3d/avGDOZ7/tW9A==\\\\ntext/csv\\\\n.csv\\\\nnew_2.csv\\\\nhttps://stradegio2aistorage.blob.core.windows.net/plant-data-3/new_2.csv\\\\n[\\\\\\\"New South Wales\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\" Queensland\\\\\\\"]\\\\n>5m\\\\n6\\\\nEast Coast Australia\\\\nLarge\\\\nLarge\\\\nShrub\\\\nShrub\\\\n3\\\\nBanksia aemula\\\\nWind/Salt tolerant\\\", \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"title\\\": null, \\\"filepath\\\": null, \\\"url\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"chunking\\\": \\\"orignal document size=495.
